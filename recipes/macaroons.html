    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

        <li>6 tablespoons superfine (castor) sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup finely ground almonds</li>

        <li>Let the cookies stand at room temperature for about 15 minutes to form a thin skin.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tops are dry, about 15 minutes; let cool completely on the baking sheets before peeling off the parchment paper.</li>
